# Landing Page Project

This is the second project for Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree Program, a Landing Page. This is a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## To get started

- clone project with `https://github.com/susumoa/landing-page.git`
- open `index.html` in your web browser

## How it works

While scrolling the page, the section which is in view is highlighted. Clicking a link in the navigation bar smoothly scrools to the corresponding section.
